# Repo Setup

Use the GitHub online interface to create a new remote project repository called something like "rock-paper-scissors-exercise". When prompted by the GitHub online interface, let's get in the habit of adding a "README.md" file and a Python-flavored ".gitignore" file (and also optionally a "LICENSE") during the repo creation process. After this process is complete, you should be able to view the repo on GitHub at an address like `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rock-paper-scissors-exercise`.

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise

# game.py

print("Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!")

# Environment Set Up 
    Create and activate a new project-specific Anaconda virtual environment:
    
sh
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
conda activate my-game-env

From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

sh
python game.py
